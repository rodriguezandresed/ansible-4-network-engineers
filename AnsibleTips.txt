All that is needed to use ansible is SSH enabled on the devices

The command "ansible --version" shows the current ansible version being used

We can check the current ansible configuration by:

cat /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

Reminder: to add hosts to a Linux device, we can:

nano /etc/hosts

And the ansible directory:

ls /etc/ansible

To see the ansible list of hosts configured:

ansible --list-hosts all

On the host file (inventory file!) you can add groups as [GroupName] or devices as:

On nano we can set marks using ALT + SHIFT + A then highlight what you cant to copy and ALT + SHIFT + 6 to copy and release with CTRL + U


We can find modules on http://docs.ansible.com

Core modules are stored at: /usr/share/pyshared/ansible/modules
